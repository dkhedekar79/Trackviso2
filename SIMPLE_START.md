# Quick Start - Just Run Vite!

**The simplest approach**: Just run Vite directly:

```bash
npm run dev
```

This will:
- ✅ Start your app on http://localhost:5173
- ✅ Hot reload on file changes
- ✅ All frontend features work perfectly

**For API testing**: Deploy to Vercel (they'll work automatically in production)

That's it! No need to fight with `vercel dev`. Just use Vite for local dev and deploy to Vercel for full testing.
