# Copy & Paste These Commands in Your Terminal

## Step 1: Initialize Git

```bash
git init
```

## Step 2: Add All Files

```bash
git add .
```

## Step 3: Make First Commit

```bash
git commit -m "Initial commit: Trackviso app with AI features"
```

---

## Step 4: Create GitHub Repository First!

**You must do this manually:**

1. Go to: https://github.com/new
2. Repository name: `Trackviso` (or any name)
3. Choose Public or Private
4. **DO NOT** check "Initialize with README"
5. Click "Create repository"

---

## Step 5: After Creating Repo, Copy These Commands

**Replace `YOUR_USERNAME` and `YOUR_REPO_NAME` with your actual GitHub info:**

```bash
git remote add origin https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/YOUR_REPO_NAME.git
git branch -M main
git push -u origin main
```

**Example** (if your username is "daiwik7" and repo is "Trackviso"):
```bash
git remote add origin https://github.com/daiwik7/Trackviso.git
git branch -M main
git push -u origin main
```

---

## Quick Copy-Paste (All at Once)

After you create the GitHub repo, copy all of this (replace YOUR_USERNAME and YOUR_REPO_NAME):

```bash
git init
git add .
git commit -m "Initial commit: Trackviso app with AI features"
git remote add origin https://github.com/YOUR_USERNAME/YOUR_REPO_NAME.git
git branch -M main
git push -u origin main
```

That's it! 🚀
